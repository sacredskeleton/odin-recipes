    <h2>What is chilli con carne?</h2>
    <p>Chilli con carne is a really easy dish. It offers loads of flavour even though it
        mostly uses store cupboard ingredients. You can add or remove spice at your own
        level by leaving the seeds in the fresh chillies or adding a pinch of dried chilli
        flakes!
    </p>
    <p>Although this dish is well known to be spicy, if that's not your cuppa,
        then feel free to remove the spice! Each serving is usually 420 calories. So
        it's quite a light dish!

            cook over a gentle heat for about 50 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally
            until the mixture is rich and thickened.

            , before removing from the heat and add any extra seasoning if necessary. Serve
